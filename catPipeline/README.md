Hello,

This demo project is meant to show my proficiency in: Terraform, AWS CodePipeline, as well as containerization. 
Each directory documents the steps to create a CI/CD pipeline that creates a Docker image, pushes it into ECR, and 
then creating a deployming onto ECS Fargate of some funny cat pictures. This was accomplished in two ways: via the
AWS console (documented with pictures,) and via a Terraform script.

Best,
Joseph Mauvais
